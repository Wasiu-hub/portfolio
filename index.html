    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring Web Developer with strong focus on the backend
      technological innovations, server-side rendering and cloud deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I was learning Java but along the line, I picked up interest in
      javascript because of its versatility, and ease with which I can build
      less complex applications as a beginner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to learn coding because of the opportunities it offers. One will
      always be challanged to learn new concepts, and it offers flexible working
      pattern. Programming langugaes are universal, hence, I can always work
      from anywhere in the world.
